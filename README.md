 **üé¨ Personalized Movie Recommendation System**
 
This project implements a scalable and efficient Movie Recommendation System using a Two-Tower Embedding (TTE) architecture inspired by Uber‚Äôs ML platform. It encodes user preferences and movie metadata into dense vector embeddings, enabling fast and personalized recommendations through Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.

Movies have a unique way of resonating with people across different cultures and backgrounds, yet our tastes in films are highly individualistic. Whether we lean towards genres like thrillers, romance, or sci-fi, or we have particular preferences for actors and directors, our movie choices are as diverse as we are. While it's difficult to pinpoint a single movie that appeals universally, data scientists use behavioral analysis to identify patterns in movie preferences across different groups.

Finding the perfect movie to watch can be overwhelming given the sheer volume of options available. To make this process easier, I‚Äôve built a simple yet powerful movie recommendation system using Python's Tkinter library and Pandas. This system allows users to search for movies, view their details, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences. Here‚Äôs a walkthrough of how we created this interactive movie recommendation tool.

**1. Dataset Preparation

The system relies on a dataset containing information about movies, including titles, genres, release dates, languages, and ratings. This dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and querying.

**2. Preprocessing Data

To ensure smooth functioning of the recommendation system, handled missing values and prepared the dataset for user queries. For instance, I replaced NaN values in the genre column with empty strings to avoid errors during filtering.
